    """OSS settings — stateless deployment.

    Auth, DB, OAuth, billing, mail relay etc. moved to the velxio-prod
    private overlay during the Phase 1-4 OSS/pro split. The overlay
    physically replaces this file at Docker build time with a richer
    Settings class that ADDS those fields on top of FRONTEND_URL (see
    pro/backend/app/core/config.py).

    Adding a setting here means the stateless OSS image will read it.
    If the new setting only makes sense with an auth/DB stack (e.g.
    SMTP creds, third-party API keys for analytics), add it to the
    overlay's config.py instead so the OSS image stays minimal.

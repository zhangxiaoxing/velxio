"""
Extension hooks for the velxio backend.

Routes that stay in OSS (compile, libraries, simulation, iot_gateway) used to
import directly from `app.core.dependencies`, `app.database.session`,
`app.models.*` and `app.services.metrics`. That made the OSS image impossible
to ship without the auth/DB stack — deleting any of those modules would
crash the route layer at import time.

This module is the seam. OSS routes import only from here. Each hook is a
no-op by default; a private overlay (e.g. velxio-prod's `app.pro`) calls the
`register_*` setter inside its own `register_pro(app)` to plug in a real
implementation. When the overlay is absent, the routes still load and the
hooks just return None / yield no events.

Adding a new extension point: define a Protocol/Callable type, a module-level
slot, a `register_*` setter, and a public callable that invokes the slot if
present. Do NOT import from `app.database`, `app.models`, or `app.services` here.

# (libraries_dir, content_token). The compiler folds the token into its build-
# variant hash (so a content change resets the build cache) and removes the dir
# after the attempt. Returns None when no overlay is loaded OR the manifest is
# empty -> the compiler uses its single default libraries dir (OSS self-host
# parity / scan-all). SYNC — pure filesystem (symlink creation).

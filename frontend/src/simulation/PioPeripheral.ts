/**
 * PioPeripheral — generic extension seam for a bit-banged-SPI/PIO peripheral
 * attached to an RP2040 board (e.g. a WiFi co-processor reached over gSPI).
 *
 * RP2040Simulator owns the fragile PIO-FIFO plumbing (the non-dropping TX
 * queue, the on-demand RX-pull, the sm.restart framing reset, the GPIO24
 * host-wake re-sync after loadMicroPython swaps the chip) and drives it
 * through this interface. A peripheral supplies only the *protocol*: it
 * observes each outbound 32-bit word and returns reply bytes the plumbing
 * repacks into the RX FIFO.
 *
 * This is deliberately generic (no product-specific names): any private SPI
 * peripheral can register a factory. In the open-source build no factory is
 * installed, so `createPioPeripheral` returns null and a pi-pico-w board
 * simulates as a plain Pico (no WiFi). The velxio.dev pro overlay registers
 * a CYW43439 implementation, gated behind a paid plan.
 *
 * Mirrors the install-impl + safe-dispatch + has-check shape of the pro
 * gates in `src/lib/proBoardGate.ts`.
